/**
 * A renderer is responsible for converting a model into a rendered document. The model
 * consists of key/value pairs, some of them potentially converted from a markup language
 * to HTML already.
 *
 * An appropriate rendering engine will be chosen by JBake based on the template suffix. If
 * contents is not available in the supplied model, a renderer has access to the document
 * database in order to complete the model.
 *
 * Note that some rendering engines may rely on a different rendering model than the one
 * provided by the first argument of {@link #renderDocument(java.util.Map, String, java.io.File)}.
 * In this case, it is the responsability of the engine to convert it.
